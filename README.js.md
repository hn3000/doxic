## Introduction

This tool makes it easy to write documentation for JavaScript or TypeScript
libraries that embeds runnable code and lets the user see the result
of actually running the code.

~~~

Click the <button disabled>Run</button> in this example to see it in action.
~~~ javascript { runnable: true }
window.alert("See? It's really simple!");
~~~


Some short text (just a short paragraph).

Some more short Text (yeah, another paragraph).

~~~ javascript { runnable: true }
// some extraordinarily long code here (use your imagination)
/*












*/

If I could find my lorem ipsum generator, that's what you'd see here.

Unfortunately I have not the faintest idea where the darned thing
is hiding right now, which leads me to producing the drivel you are
reading right now. It's not pretty, I know, but it will certainly do
the job.

More text that could have been fake latin, but is not.

Some more Text.

    window.alert('just some code -- no options, therefor not runnable');
